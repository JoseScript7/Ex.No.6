# Ex.No.6 – Development of Python Code Compatible with Multiple AI Tools  
### Date:  28.11.2025
### Register No:  212224040269



## **Aim**
To write and implement Python code that integrates with multiple AI tools in order to automate interactions with external APIs, compare the generated outputs, and extract actionable insights. The experiment evaluates how different AI models generate code when prompted with the same task.



## **AI Tools Used**
- **ChatGPT (OpenAI GPT-5)**
- **Google Gemini (Gemini 1.5 Pro / Pro Vision)**
- Python 3.x  
- External APIs:  
  - OpenWeatherMap  
  - WeatherAPI  



## **Explanation**
This experiment applies the **persona prompting pattern** (acting as a Python programmer) to generate API-integrated Python scripts using multiple AI tools.  

The workflow includes:

1. **Generating Python code** using two different AI models for the same task.  
2. **Fetching weather data** from two external APIs (OpenWeatherMap and WeatherAPI).  
3. **Comparing the outputs** of the two API responses using AI-generated comparison functions.  
4. **Generating analytical insights** based on differences between the two APIs.  
5. **Documenting differences** in coding structure, modularity, and robustness between ChatGPT and Gemini.  

A complete, detailed multi-page analysis of the experiment is provided in the attached PDF report.

- Full methodology  
- Task 1: API data retrieval scripts (ChatGPT vs Gemini)  
- Task 2: Comparison function outputs  
- Task 3: Insight generation logic  
- Structural, technical, and qualitative comparison of both AI-generated codes  
- Reflection and observations  
- Final conclusions  


## **Conclusion**
The experiment clearly demonstrates that different AI tools produce distinct programming styles and levels of robustness, even under identical prompts. The code generated by ChatGPT tended to be concise and beginner-friendly, while Gemini produced more structured, production-ready modules with stronger error handling.


## **Result**
The corresponding prompt was executed successfully, and the Python code was generated, compared, and documented using multiple AI tools.
